# Loan Management System (Web Application)

The Loan Management System is a web application that aims to solve the problems of traditional loan application systems by 
providing a user-friendly platform for users to apply for loans, view their loan details, and make EMI payments. Additionally, 
the system includes an admin module for loan officers to approve user loan applications efficiently.

## Features

- User Registration and Authentication: Users can create an account and log in to access the loan application and other features.
- Loan Application: Users can apply for loans by providing necessary details and documents.
- Loan List: Users can view a list of their active loans and their respective details.
- EMI Payment: Users can make EMI payments using various payment methods.
- Admin Module: Loan officers with admin credentials can approve or reject user loan applications.
